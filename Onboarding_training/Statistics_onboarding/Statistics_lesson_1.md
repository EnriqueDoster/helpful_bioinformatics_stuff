## What is R and why do we use it?
["R"](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is an open-source programming language that we use for analyzing microbiome and resistome count matrices.

To facilitate the use of R we recommend using the GUI software, [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).

## Task
* Install R and R studio on your computer following [these instructions](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu).
