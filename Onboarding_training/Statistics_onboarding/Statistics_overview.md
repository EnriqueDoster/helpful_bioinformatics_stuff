# Statistics lesson plan overview

## Tutorial details
* 4 total lessons. 1 lesson per week, for 4 weeks.
  * There is 1 "deliverable" per lesson, that needs to be sent to "meglab.metagenomics@gmail.com"
* We will meet once per week to go over each lesson.
* We are developing these training resources for our team and we would love to get your input on improvements to any components.
  * You can either contact Enrique Doster (enriquedoster@gmail.com), or use github to submit your proposed changes directly.
* We will work as a team to help answer each other's questions.

# Lesson 1 ["Getting set up"](https://github.com/EnriqueDoster/Bioinformatic_resources/blob/master/Onboarding_training/Statistics_onboarding/Statistics_lesson_1.md)
* Goals:
  * Step 1: Download and install R/RStudio
  * Step 2: Install R packages
  * Step 3: Explore basic R functionality.
  * Step 4: Learn how to read-in data to R and provide general information about files.
* Resources:
  * [Installing R](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)
  * [YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)
    * This is a free online book that goes over many useful topics in a quirky, but fun way! Follow along with our simplified R scripts in Lesson 1 and reference this book if you have any other questions.
  * [R programming coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
    * This free coursera course goes in-depth with all of the functionality of R. It combines videos with example R scripts for you to follow along with. We recommend this course after you have been playing around with R a bit and want to learn more about the details into how R works.
  * [Introduction to R workshop](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2018-introduction-to-R/)
  
  
* Deliverables:
  * For Step 1 and 2, students must send a screenshot of their "sessionInfo()" to ensure that R and R studio are installed in addition to the necessary R packages, respectively.
  * Step 3 - After familiarizing themselves with some basic R functionality, students will submit a short quiz.
  * Step 4 - Given a count matrix file, taxonomy file, and sample metadata file, students must read-in all data to R and provide:
    * The number of rows and columns for each file
    * A short description of what kind of samples are being analyzed
    * A short description of what the taxonomy contains and how it relates to the count table.
