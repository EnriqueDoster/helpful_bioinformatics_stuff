## Goals for this repository

* First, function as a place that helps me organize the various resources I used to learn about bioinformatic anaylysis of the microbiome and resistome.
* Eventually, create useful tutorials to help others learn about bioinformatics.

## Contribute

##### Disclaimer: The following guide is meant as a general overview of we, the Microbial Ecology Group, does to analyze metagenomic sequencing samples. We attempt to keep up with the latest in “best practices”, but these analytic tools continue to improve and the correct combination of tools and statistical methods is in perpetual debate. Please let us know if you have any questions, require clarification, or want to help us improve our methods!
